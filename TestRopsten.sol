      An ERC-20 token must be able to:

    - Transfer tokens from one account to another
    - Return the balance of an account
    - Return the total tokens available in the token
    - Transfer tokens to an account

      ERC20 Tokens usually have some functions as below:

    - name() returns the name of the token (e.g., Binance Coin)
    - symbol() returns the symbol of the token (e.g., BNB)
    - decimals() returns the number of decimals the token uses
    - totalSupply() returns the total number initially supplied to the token
    - balanceOf() returns the balance of an account
    - transfer() transfers a certain amount of tokens to an address
    - transferFrom() transfers a certain amount of tokens from a beneficiary address to a recipient address
    - approve() withdraws tokens from the ownerâs address up to a certain amount of tokens
    - allowance() returns the number of tokens withdrawable from the ownerâs account

    This method has the following arguments:

    receiver: the address of the account that will receive tokens
    numTokens: the number of tokens that will be sent to the receiver account

    In the body of the method, we see that a check is made to verify that the number of tokens to be sent to the recipient is enough according to the deployerâs address balance.

    Next, the numTokens is subtracted from the deployerâs balance and credited to the receiverâs balance. Then, a Transfer event is emitted. Finally, the Boolean true is returned.

    The transferFrom() function transfers the tokens from an owner's account to the receiver account, but only if the transaction initiator 
    has sufficient allowance that has been previously approved by the owner to the transaction initiator. 
    To transfer the tokens using the transferFrom() function, approver must have called the approve() function prior. 
    As per the standard, the transferFrom() function must fire the Transfer event upon the successful execution and transfer of tokens. 
    The transfer of 0 (zero) value must also be treated as a valid transfer and should fire the Transfer event.
